            <p>As a friend of Converse Rubber Tracks and Indaba Music, we’d like to invite you to a one-of-a kind music event at Rubber Tracks Studio in Brooklyn on Tuesday, May 27 and Wednesday, May 28. 
            </p><p>As you know, Rubber Tracks is a community based studio in Brooklyn NYC where musicians record for free every day. Converse is working with Indaba Music on an exciting new initiative to bring the Rubber Tracks experience online. In the community spirit of Rubber Tracks, Converse will take samples and loops from music recorded at Rubber Tracks to create a free, online sound library for independent artists. This project will benefit musicians around the world and foster an environment of collaboration and artistic creation.</p><p>Upon its launch later this summer, the online sound library will feature thousands of free samples and loops donated by talented musicians who have recorded at Rubber Tracks. Musicians around the world will be able to browse the sound library and download samples to use in their own projects. Only samples that are approved and 100% cleared by the contributing musicians will be included in the library. The idea is to foster a positive, collaborative environment where musicians are helping other musicians in a free and open way.</p><p>As a friend of Rubber Tracks and Indaba Music, we’d like to specially invite you to a special event to help create some of the content for the Rubber Tracks sound library. The 24 Hour Rubber Tracks Music Party will take place between Tuesday, May 27 and Wednesday, May 28. Each day there will be 12 hour marathon jam sessions with participating musicians.</p><p>On May 28 at 7pm, there will be a party with food and drinks for everyone involved. All musicians participating will get credited on the Rubber Tracks sound library site when it launches later this year. This is a great opportunity to hang and record with other super talented musicians in an amazing studio space, and to be part of a really cool project.</p><p>If you are interested in participating, please fill out the form to us know when you’d like to stop by to record a few samples, and let us if you can make the party as well. This is a special invite for you, if you have a friend you'd like to bring, let us know. Only people who are on the list will be admitted to the sample session and party, so make sure you respond and sign-up.</p><p>See you there!</p><h1>Converse Rubber Tracks and Indaba Music</h1>
